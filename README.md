# Biometric_Person_Identification
Developed a person identification model based on iris database using machine learning tools

Main points:

•	Detect human iris on a photos using Python libraries OpenCV, SciPy, and Scikit-Image.

•	Compared performance of two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform, two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, and two-dimensional wavelet transform.

•	Compared accuracy of K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GBC), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and other classifiers.
